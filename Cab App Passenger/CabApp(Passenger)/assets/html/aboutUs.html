        <li>Passengers can register by completing their details on the App. Drivers may register by completing their details on the App or on the Website.

        <li>Drivers who register for the cab:app Service via the App or the Website will receive a message informing the Driver that their profile is “pending” and that they are required to supply cab:app with a copy of their taxi cab licence. Once cab:app receives the Driver’s taxi cab licence, cab:app shall verify details of the Driver and once approved the Driver’s registration process will be completed and the Driver shall receive an email or text message (“Confirmation Email or Text”) confirming their registration and that the Driver can now use the cab:app Service.

    </ol>
    
    <h1>DETAILS OF THE CAB:APP SERVICE</h1>
    <ol>
    	<li>Once registered, a Passenger will be able to electronically hail a taxi via the options available through the App or the Website, including but not limited to “Hail Now”, “Pre-Book” and “Fixed Price” (together known as “Hail”). You acknowledge that some options to Hail may not be available in certain cities. Drivers may accept a Passenger’s Hail and once accepted a Passenger will be able to track their Driver as the Driver proceeds to the Passenger’s pick-up address. </li>
        <li>Drivers may start the taxi meter at the pick up address, from the pick up time agreed with the Passenger. In respect of a Fixed Price Hail, the Passenger acknowledges that this may be subject to change if the Driver is kept waiting for longer than five (5) minutes after the agreed pick up time submitted through the App or the Website. Any additional amount over and above the Fixed Price fare for such additional waiting time should be decided between the Driver and the Passenger. cab:app accepts no responsibility or liability whatsoever in respect of any additional costs incurred by the Passenger as a result of any failure by the Passenger to meet the Driver at the agreed pick up time. </li>
        <li>Passengers will also be able to manage their bookings via the “My Bookings” facility, and amend their profile details at “My Details” on the App. </li>
        <li>When a Driver registers with cab:app their details will be sent to cab:app for approval and authorisation before the Driver’s account becomes live. Once activated and registered Drivers will be able to view jobs in the local vicinity (viewing both pick-up and destination address) at “Jobs” under “Now” and also preview all “Pre-Booked” jobs (and, if available, all Fixed Price Hails), via the App. Drivers will be able to manage their account and view their “My Jobs”. Subject to arrival at the pick up address, a Driver may only start the meter from the agreed pick up time with the Passenger.</li>
        <li>
        	<ol>In respect of Fixed Price Hails, the Driver acknowledges and agrees that:
            	<li>in the event the metered fare, on arrival at the Passenger’s destination, is lower than the Fixed Price fare, the Driver shall only charge the lower metered fare; </li>
                <li>in the event the metered fare, on arrival at the Passenger’s destination, is higher than the Fixed Price fare, the Driver shall only charge the Fixed Price fare, but in the event the Driver is kept waiting at the pick up address for longer than five (5) minutes after the agreed pick up time, the Driver reserves the right to charge an amount in addition to the Fixed Price fare, such amount to be reasonable and proportional to the waiting time and agreed with the Passenger. cab:app accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses or costs incurred by the Driver arising as a result of a Passenger failing to meet the Driver at the agreed pick up time. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For each Hail that a Driver accepts, credit(s) (“Credit”) will be deducted. All Hails will result in a deduction of one (1) Credit, save in respect of Fixed Price Hails, where 2 Credits shall be deducted.  Drivers can only accept a Hail if they have sufficient Credit(s) on their profile. Drivers can add Credits on the App or Website, but the Driver acknowledges that the cost of Credits may vary depending on the city in which the Driver is operating. Credits may only be refunded at cab:app’s sole discretion. </li>
        <li>The App offers Passengers the choice to pay the Driver by debit or credit card. Cab:app’s payment service provider is PCI compliant and any card details submitted by a Passenger are held on a secure server and will not be disclosed to any other person. Passengers paying by debit or credit card may be subject to an additional transaction fee. Passengers who elect to pre-register their debit or credit card details in advance of payment in respect of use of the App by using ‘Add Card’ will be subject to a small transaction fee of approximately GBP 0.15 which is the cost of verifying and processing a card in advance.</li>
        <li>cab:app shall deposit Passenger payments into a Driver’s bank account as soon as reasonably practicable following cab:app receiving confirmation of the Passenger’s payment in cleared funds, subject to the deduction by cab:app of a transfer fee each time such a transfer to the Driver’s account is made. The Driver acknowledges and agrees that he/she is responsible for ensuring that their bank details are correct and up to date at all times. cab:app shall not be liable for any losses or costs incurred by the Driver as a result of failing to update his/her bank account details or for any other errors or omissions outside of cab:app’s reasonable control (including but not limited to the failure of the bank’s automated clearing services failing to deposit funds).</li>
        <li>Drivers acknowledge that payments made by debit or credit card may be subject to fraudulent or illegal activity. In the event the Passenger’s bank, building society, credit card company or such other financial service provider, including any company or collection agency acting on its behalf (“Bank”) makes any claim against cab:app for recovery of payments made to cab:app through use of the App, Website or cab:app Services, cab:app reserves the right to recover from the Driver such amounts claimed by the Bank. </li>
        <li>Drivers using the cab:app Service agree to adhere to the Relevant Taxi laws and any Driver found to be failing to comply either these Terms or the Relevant Taxi Laws will be suspended or removed from the cab:app Service. We strongly recommend all Drivers read and fully understand the Relevant Taxi laws. </li>
        
        
        <li>
        	<ol>Each Driver shall warrant and agree that they:
            	<li>possess a valid driver’s licence and are authorised to operate a taxi and have all the appropriate licences, approvals and authority to provide transportation for hire.</li>
                <li>have the legal right to operate the taxi which they intend to use when accepting Passengers and that such taxi is in good condition and meets industry safety standards.</li>
                <li>have valid public liability insurance policy in place.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>In agreeing to these Terms both Drivers and Passengers agree to allow each other to see each other’s relevant locations via GPS tracking technology after a Driver has accepted a particular Passenger’s Hail. </li>
        <li>GPS tracking technology will cease to function when the Driver either informs the Passenger they are at the pickup location by tapping the “Arrived at pick up” button or after “Payment” has been taken.</li>
        <li>Drivers using the cab:app Service warrant and undertake that they will not start the charging meter for the Passenger until they are outside the Passenger’s pickup address. </li>
        <li>Passengers using the cab:app Service acknowledge that Drivers may be entitled to charge additional fees on all Hails made via the App in accordance with the Relevant Taxi Laws and any applicable fare guides. Such additional fees may include, but are not limited to, telephone/internet booking fees, chargeable at the Driver’s discretion.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to make such changes to the App or the Website or part thereof from time to time at our sole discretion, and we may from time to time update, add, remove, modify and/or vary any elements, features or functionalities of the App or the Website. </li>
